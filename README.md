# Pragmatic-Implementation-of-Reinforcement-Algorithms-For-Path-Finding-On-Raspberry-Pi
In this project, we did a pragmatic implementation of an indoor autonomous
delivery system that exploits Q-learning and Deep Q-learning which are reinforcement
learning algorithms,for path-finding and obstacle avoidance in a given environment.
The main computation is done on the device and the best possible path is hosted
online using an API which is then extracted by the Raspberry Pi module. The
implementation is done using motor driver and encoders. The proposed system is
a moderately cost-efficient approach that is implemented to compute the shortest
path between the source key point and destination key point to carry out the desired
delivery and then navigate through the path by avoiding the obstacles in the path.
